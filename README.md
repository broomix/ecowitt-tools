These are a few tools for managing Ecowitt weather sensors and devices,
including the versions sold under other brand names, such as Ambient,
Misol, and Froggit.

Everything is initially developed on FreeBSD Unix, then tested and adapted
as necessary to run on the Raspberry Pi OS version of Debian Linux.

Any feedback and patches to allow supporting other operating systems would
be quite welcome.
